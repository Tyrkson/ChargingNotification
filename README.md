# ChargingNotification

Main objective of this app is to show a notification while phone is charging.

It only shows it when phone is charging, thus if you plug the phone with a charger and notification doesn't pop up then it means,
that it isn't connected correctly.

NB! App sometimes doesn't pop up a notification while charging and this is acknowledged bug and it may happen vice versa too.

This project was just my experiment to upload a project from Android Studio to GitHub.
