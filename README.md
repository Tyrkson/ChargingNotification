# ChargingNotification

Main objective of this app is to show a notification while phone is charging.

It only shows it when phone is really charing, thus if you plug charger in and notification doesn't pop up then it means,
that it isn't connected correctly.

NB! App sometimes doesn't pop up a notification while charging and this is acknowledged bug and it may happen vice versa too.

This project was just my experiment to upload a project from Android Studio to GitHub.
